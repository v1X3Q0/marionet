<p>Noting that vulnerability research isn’t an easy field to jump into, I decided
to make a gitpage with my exploits out of the office. Tasks I’ll be covering for
the most part are things that took way to much time to do, and had I had a
simple blog post with instructions I would have saved a bunch of time. Should
anyone have questions, I take emails at v1X3Q0@gmail.com</p>
