# the little things that help!

Noting that vulnerability research isn't an easy field to jump into, I decided to make a gitpage with my exploits out of the office. Tasks I'll be covering for the most part are things that took way to much time to do, and had I had a simple blog post with instructions I would have saved a bunch of time. Should anyone have questions, I take emails at v1X3Q0@gmail.com
