<p>Noting that vulnerability research isnâ€™t an easy field to jump into, I decided
to make a gitpage with my exploits out of the office. Tasks Iâ€™ll be covering for
the most part are things that took way to much time to do, and had I had a
simple blog post with instructions I would have saved a bunch of time. I decided
to also upload some documentation of a few tools. Should anyone have questions,
I take emails at v1X3Q0@gmail.com</p>
